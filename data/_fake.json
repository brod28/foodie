I emailed promptly 60 days prior (at 10:00 a.m.) since the site would not let me book and was told they were fully booked. They gave me a list of other restaurants to eat at. Disappointing attitude.  Will surely eat where my business is welcome and appreciated."

The place seems to be popular as there was a queue outside to get in at 10PM when we were leaving. The middle eastern food however was a mixed bag, some dishes were good, some not so. I liked the salads and octopus with chickpea mash. Jerusalem Mix was a bit of a hoax though, the plate full of fried onions and couple of pieces of chicken liver buried underneath it. £14.5 dish with no much food on the plate..."
